# 🤖 Chatbot Development with OpenAI

This repository contains my work from the **Curso de Desarrollo de Chatbots con OpenAI**, where I explored how to build AI-powered chatbots using the OpenAI API and applied these concepts in a real project.

The main goal of this project was to understand how to interact with OpenAI models programmatically, apply fine-tuning concepts, calculate token usage and costs, and integrate an AI chatbot with Telegram.

---

## 🚀 What I Built

* A chatbot powered by the **OpenAI API**
* A **fine-tuned language model** based on custom training data
* Token usage and **cost calculation** for fine-tuning
* A **Telegram bot** created using BotFather
* Local execution of the chatbot for development and testing

> ⚠️ Note: The Telegram chatbot currently runs **locally** on my machine and is not deployed to a production server yet.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

* OpenAI API fundamentals
* Prompt design and response generation
* Fine-tuning a language model
* Dataset preparation and validation
* Token counting and cost estimation
* API usage monitoring
* Telegram Bot integration

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenAI API
* Telegram Bot API (BotFather)
* JSON / JSONL datasets
* Virtual environments for local development

---

## 📊 Fine-Tuning & Cost Calculation

As part of the course, I:

* Prepared training and validation datasets
* Calculated the number of tokens used during training
* Estimated fine-tuning costs based on token usage
* Evaluated model behavior after fine-tuning

This helped me understand the **economic and technical impact** of using fine-tuned models in real applications.

---

## 📌 Current Limitations

* The Telegram bot is not deployed (local execution only)
* No persistent database (stateless interactions)
* Intended for learning and experimentation purposes

## 📚 About the Course

This project was developed as part of a learning path focused on **AI-powered applications and chatbots**, emphasizing practical implementation over theory.
