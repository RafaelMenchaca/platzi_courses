# Platzi Courses – OpenAI API & AI Development

This repository documents my learning journey through Platzi courses focused on **AI development using the OpenAI API**.  
It includes hands-on projects, experiments, and examples built while learning how to integrate AI capabilities into real applications.

The goal of this repo is to **learn by building**, understand how OpenAI models work in practice, and apply them correctly in real-world scenarios.

### 🔹 Function Calling
- How to define functions for external logic
- Letting the model decide when to call a function
- Using functions for:
  - Weather data
  - Precise calculations
  - External API access

### 🔹 Image Analysis (Vision)
- Sending images to GPT models for analysis
- Using:
  - Base64-encoded images (local files)
  - Image URLs
- Extracting structured and descriptive insights from images

### 🔹 Speech Capabilities
- Speech-to-Text (audio → text)
- Text-to-Speech (text → audio)
- Understanding when and how to use each capability

### 🔹 Platzi Vision Chatbot
- Built a chatbot capable of:
  - Analyzing images
  - Responding in real time (streaming)
  - Handling multimodal inputs (text + image)
- Understanding frontend–backend separation
- Using OpenAI API from a backend service
